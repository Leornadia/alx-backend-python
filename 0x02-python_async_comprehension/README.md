## Introduction

Asynchronous comprehensions are a powerful feature introduced in Python 3.6 that enable the use of `async for` within list, set, and dictionary comprehensions. This project aims to showcase how to use these comprehensions to handle asynchronous data efficiently.

## Features

- Demonstrates the use of `async for` in list, set, and dictionary comprehensions.
- Provides examples of handling asynchronous data streams.
- Includes performance comparisons with synchronous comprehensions.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x02-python-async-comprehension.git
