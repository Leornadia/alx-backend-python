# 0x01. Python - Async

## Description
This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python. It covers fundamental concepts of async programming, including coroutines, async/await syntax, and working with asyncio.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the concept of asynchronous programming
- Understand and use async and await syntax
- Execute an async program with asyncio
- Run concurrent coroutines
- Create asyncio tasks
- Use the random module in an async environment

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pycodestyle (version 2.5.x)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Files
List of files and their descriptions:

1. `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Introduction to async syntax
2. `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Running concurrent coroutines
3. `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measuring execution time of async operations
4. `3-tasks.py`: Working with asyncio tasks
5. `4-tasks.py`: Advanced usage of asyncio tasks

## Usage
Provide examples of how to run your scripts, e.g.:

```bash
python3 0-basic_async_syntax.py
```
